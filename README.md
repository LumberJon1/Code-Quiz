# Code Quiz

## What it does:
The Code Quiz is a "timed" (scored) quiz that will test users' abilities to answer
programming questions similar to a technical interview.

Questions are multiple-choice, and incorrect answers will subtract time from the score.

Once all questions are answered or timer reaches 0, the score will be displayed, along with
any previous high scores.  The quiz will allow users to enter their name if a high score is
achieved.

## Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz...

* WHEN I click the start button
*   THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question

* WHEN I answer a question
*   THEN I am presented with another question

* WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
*   THEN time is subtracted from the clock

* WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
*   THEN the game is over

* WHEN the game is over
*   THEN I can save my initials and score
